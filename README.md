**Project Name:** AutoIt File Sorter

**Description:**

AutoIt File Sorter is a simple Windows application with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI), built using AutoIt, that allows users to organize files within a source folder based on their file extensions.

**Key Features:**

1. **User-Friendly GUI:** The application provides an intuitive and easy-to-use GUI, including an input field for selecting the source folder, a "Browse" button for folder selection, and a "Sort Files" button to initiate the sorting process.

2. **Source Folder Selection:** Users can easily choose the source folder by using the "Browse" button.

3. **Automatic File Sorting:** Once the user has selected the source folder, the application automatically retrieves a list of files within the folder and organizes them into subfolders corresponding to their file extensions.

4. **Result Notification:** After the sorting process is complete, the application displays a notification to inform the user that the files have been successfully sorted.

**Objective:**

**Benefits:**

- Saves time and effort when sorting files within a folder.
- Facilitates easy file management and searching based on file extensions.
- Simplifies file browsing and organization.

**Source Code:**

The project's source code has been compiled into an executable (.exe) file for ease of use and sharing with others.

**Note:** Before using this application, make sure to back up important files, especially when automating file sorting, to prevent the loss of critical data.
